The Toll System based on the Global Positioning System which is simply addressed as GPS is a great tool that can be used to implement Toll Revenue collection.
This system can be built with the help of microchips and embedded python in an ideal real life scenario.
In this project, we have simulated the functioning of such a system using basic python functions and libraries.
In this project, I have incorporated real life nuances of the Indian Toll System and builtÂ  an Interactive UI which can be operated by any simple common man to pay their Toll Fare.
The simulation UI has clear instructions and visual elements which make the system very easy to use and accessible for all.
The UI stimulates a Toll System that is based on GPS.
